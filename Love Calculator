# MY CODE & MODEL CODE (cause I had to take a look at the solution haha)

names = name1 + name2
lnames = names.lower()

t = lnames.count("t")
r = lnames.count("r")
u = lnames.count("u")
e = lnames.count("e")

first_digit = t + r + u + e

l = lnames.count("l")
o = lnames.count("o")
v = lnames.count("v")

second_digit = l + o + v + e

score = int(str(first_digit) + str(second_digit))

if score < 10 or score > 90:
    print(f"Your score is {score}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
    
elif score > 40 and score < 50:
    print(f"Your score is {score}, you are alright together.")
    
else:
    print(f"Your score is {score}.")
