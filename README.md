# CodeJourney
My early projects and practices

I have compiled here all the coding projects and programs that I have created while learning how to code in Python. Some of them are brief blocks of code that are able to perform interesting tasks. There are also larger programs capable of much more functionality, these are named with the capital letter "P" followed by a serial number and title.
